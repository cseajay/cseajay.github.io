You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/cseajay/cseajay.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
3      A logical picture of facts is a thought.
3.001 'A state of affairs is thinkable’: what this means is that we
       can picture it to ourselves.
3.01   The totality of true thoughts is a picture of the world.
3.02   A thought contains the possibility of the situation
       of which it is the thought. What is thinkable is possible
       too.
3.03   Thought can never be of anything illogical, since, if it
       were, we should have to think illogically.
3.031  It used to be said that God could create anything except
       what would be contrary to the laws of logic.—The truth
       is that we could not say what an ‘illogical’ world would
       look like.

5      That is the foundation of the theory of probability
5.101  The truth-functions of a given number of elementary
       propositions can always be set out in a schema of the
       following kind:
1      (T T T T) (p, q) Tautology (If p then p, and if q then q.) (p ⊃ p . q ⊃ q)
2      (F T T T) (p, q) In words: Not both p and q. (∼(p . q))
3      (T F T T) (p, q) ,, ,, : If q then p. (q ⊃ p)
4      (T T F T) (p, q) ,, ,, : If p then q. (p ⊃ q)
5      (T T T F) (p, q) ,, ,, : p or q. (p v q)
6      (F F T T) (p, q) ,, ,, : Not q. (∼q)
7      (F T F T) (p, q) ,, ,, : Not p. (∼p)
8      (F T T F) (p, q) ,, ,, : p or q, but not both. (p . ∼q : v : q . ∼p)
9      (T F F T) (p, q) ,, ,, : If p then q, and if q then p. (p ≡ q)
10     (T F T F) (p, q) ,, ,, : p
11     (T T F F) (p, q) ,, ,, : q
12     (F F F T) (p, q) ,, ,, : Neither p nor q. (∼P .~q or pq)
13     (F F T F) (p, q) ,, ,, : p and not q. (p . ~q)
14     (F T F F) (p, q) ,, ,, : q and not p. (q . ∼p)
15     (T F F F) (p, q) ,, ,, : q and p. (q . p)
16     (F F F F) (p, q) Contradiction (p and not p, and q and not q.) (p . ∼p . q . ∼q)

```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/cseajay/cseajay.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
