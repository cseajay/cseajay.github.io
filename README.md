```Logic
3      A logical picture of facts is a thought.
3.001 'A state of affairs is thinkable’: what this means is that we
       can picture it to ourselves.
3.01   The totality of true thoughts is a picture of the world.
3.02   A thought contains the possibility of the situation
       of which it is the thought. What is thinkable is possible
       too.
3.03   Thought can never be of anything illogical, since, if it
       were, we should have to think illogically.
3.031  It used to be said that God could create anything except
       what would be contrary to the laws of logic.—The truth
       is that we could not say what an ‘illogical’ world would
       look like.

5      That is the foundation of the theory of probability
5.101  The truth-functions of a given number of elementary
       propositions can always be set out in a schema of the
       following kind:
1      (T T T T) (p, q) Tautology (If p then p, and if q then q.) (p ⊃ p . q ⊃ q)
2      (F T T T) (p, q) In words: Not both p and q. (∼(p . q))
3      (T F T T) (p, q) ,, ,, : If q then p. (q ⊃ p)
4      (T T F T) (p, q) ,, ,, : If p then q. (p ⊃ q)
5      (T T T F) (p, q) ,, ,, : p or q. (p v q)
6      (F F T T) (p, q) ,, ,, : Not q. (∼q)
7      (F T F T) (p, q) ,, ,, : Not p. (∼p)
8      (F T T F) (p, q) ,, ,, : p or q, but not both. (p . ∼q : v : q . ∼p)
9      (T F F T) (p, q) ,, ,, : If p then q, and if q then p. (p ≡ q)
10     (T F T F) (p, q) ,, ,, : p
11     (T T F F) (p, q) ,, ,, : q
12     (F F F T) (p, q) ,, ,, : Neither p nor q. (∼P .~q or pq)
13     (F F T F) (p, q) ,, ,, : p and not q. (p . ~q)
14     (F T F F) (p, q) ,, ,, : q and not p. (q . ∼p)
15     (T F F F) (p, q) ,, ,, : q and p. (q . p)
16     (F F F F) (p, q) Contradiction (p and not p, and q and not q.) (p . ∼p . q . ∼q)
